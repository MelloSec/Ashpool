## Automated Scan Host

### A lightweight  recon tool/vulnerability scanner built using PowerShell and Nmap

#### Glue: PowerShell for filesystem operations, automation and data processing

#### Engine: Nmap scripting engine for discovery, enumeration and initial vulnerability detection

#### Logic: Bash script - nmap-parse-output: https://github.com/ernw/nmap-parse-output

#### Parses XML output of NMap scans for us to create custom target and port lists for further scanning and group hosts for HTML reports
#### Runs scripts and tools against these lists and prepares results for presentation, then stores scan output for optional further processing
